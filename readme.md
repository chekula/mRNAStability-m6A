The repository contains the code to generate plots , statistics and supporting tables for Figs 1D, 1G, 2A, 2C-F, 3A, 3C-E, 4A, 4D, 5A, 5H, 5J, 6A-B, 7A-D, S1C, S1E, S2A-B, S6A-D for Loedige et al. mRNA stability and m6A are major determinants of subcellular mRNA localization in neurons.

Data organisation: data folder contains the files required for building the plots. Zipped files need to be unzipped before running the code. The code and output plots&tables for each figure are in dedicated folders, e.g. F1_S1, F2, F3_S2B, F4, F5-S6C-D, F6, F7,S2A, S6.
